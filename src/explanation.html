              When Bitcoin was invented more than 10 years ago, few would have guessed that some random numbers on a computer could one
              day be worth thousands of dollars. Since then, many have heard of Bitcoin and some have actively used it. Yet,
              only a few have really understood it.

            <p class="tb">
              Today buzzwords like 'Blockchain' and 'Cryptocurrency' are spreading like wildfire, but hardly anyone seems to have any interest
              in understanding how Bitcoin really works and why it's such a big deal. Time to find out.

              If you want to send money from person A to B using today's monetary system, chances are that you will need some kind of intermediary
              like a bank or Paypal. Such a central entity provides two important services. It keeps track of all transactions
              in a central database and is hence able to determine the account balance of every person. It also ensures that
              only the rightful owner of an account can make a transaction (password login, tan).
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              However, this convenience comes at a cost. Such a system has a single point of failure. As the transaction database is centrally
              controlled, it can be manipulated at whim. Governments can seize control over your bank account, withdrawals
              can be limited or blocked entirely or services can become unavailable due to technical issues, let alone negative
              interest rates and creeping inflation.

            <p class="tb">
              In a world without banks, bank accounts obviously don't exist either. So the first thing we need is some kind of digital
              identity. Basically two things: the equivalent of a bank account number and the equivalent of a password. Such
              a thing is called <b>Wallet</b> containing two numbers: <b>Public Key</b> and <b>Private Key</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Let's see how they come about.
            </p>


            <p class="tb">
              It all starts with a random number. A very big random number with a length of 256-bit. This means a random arrangement of
              256 zeros and ones. You could generate such a number by flipping a coin 256 times and writing down "1" for
              heads and "0" for tails.

                ${rand2}
              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                If we convert that number to our familiar decimal system we get an insanely large number with more than 70 digits roughly
                equaling the number of atoms in our universe : <span class="has-text-weight-semibold is-size-7">${rand10}</span>
              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                We can use the hexadecimal system to get a relatively compact representation of this random 256-bit number, which we will
                call <b class="has-text-primary">Private Key</b>:
              </p>

                ${rand16}
              </p>


              <p class="tb">
                Pause a moment and think about the following: This particular number above has never existed before in the history of the
                world and will never ever show up again once you leave this page or generate a new one. It's like you will
                never flip 256 coins in a row with the exact same outcome twice. The numbers involved are unimaginably large,
                it's practically impossible.
              </p>

              <p class="tb">

              It's not so easy anymore, right? Your best bet is to try out different primes, calculate the product and check if it equals
              58637. In cryptography we love these kind of problems - easy to calculate in one direction, but very hard to

              Cool! We're making progress. Even though the math involved with elliptic curves is intriguingly complex, it's actually pretty
              easy to get the key idea. So hold on.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              The first thing you need to know is that there exist two basic operations on the elliptic curve. Point Doubling and Point
              Addition. Remember that we always start from <b>Generator Point G</b>.
            </p>


            <div class="is-flex tb" style="justify-content: center; margin: 2rem 0">

                <label class="label has-text-black">Point Doubling</label>

                <p class="tb">
                  We draw the tangent line at the point we want to double. This line intersects the elliptic curve at another point. We then
                  mirror this point around the X-axis. That's it.
                </p>

                <p class="tb">
                  Take a look at the example on the right. We start at the generator point <b>G</b>, draw the tangent line,
                  mirror the point of intersection around the X-axis and end up with <b>2*G</b>. Easy.
                </p>

                <p class="tb">
                  What if we wanted to get the points <b>4*G</b> or <b>8*G</b>. How would you do that?
                </p>

                <p class="tb">
                  The second operation is very similar. We can add up two points on the curve by drawing a line through them. This line will
                  intersect the elliptic curve at a third point. We again mirror it around the X-axis to get the resulting
                  point.
                </p>

                <p class="tb">
                  In the example on the right we add <b>G</b> and <b>2*G</b> by drawing a line through them, mirror the point
                  of intersection around the X-axis and end up with <b>3*G</b>.

                </p>

                <p class="tb">
                  Starting from the generator point <b>G</b> we can construct any arbitrary multiple (2G, 3G, 4G, etc.) with
                  these two operations.

                <p class="tb">
                  On the right you see the elliptic curve with two points. The generator point <b>G</b> and another point
                  <b>?*G</b>. Can you tell me what the value of the 'question mark' is - how often did we jump to get from
                  <b>G</b> to
                  <b>?*G</b>?
                </p>

                <p class="tb">
                  This is extremely difficult and there exist no efficient algorithms to calculate it. Our best bet is to simply try different
                  multiples of <b>G</b> until the endpoint matches our desired point <b>?*G</b>. So starting
                  from <b>G</b> we calculate
                  <b>2G</b> and see if it matches <b>?*G</b>, then <b>3G, 4G, 5G</b> etc...
                </p>

                <p class="tb">
                  What we now have is exactly what we want. It's easy to calculate the coordinates of the endpoint from the number of jumps,
                  but very hard the other way round.

              We will now use this to generate our Bitcoin wallet. Let's take the <b>Private Key</b>, the large 256bit random
              number you just generated several minutes ago:
            </p>

            <p class="tb is-size-7 has-text-weight-semibold  has-text-primary">
              ${rand16}
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Let's take this number in decimal notation and calculate:
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              <b class="has-text-primary">Private Key</b><b>*G</b> = <span class="has-text-primary">${rand10}</span><b>*G</b>
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Using point doubling and point addition we jump along the elliptic curve until we reach <span class="has-text-primary">${rand10}</span><b>*G</b>.
              We then take the x-coordinate of the endpoint and call it <b class="has-text-info">Public Key</b>:
            </p>

            <p class="tb has-text-weight-semibold is-size-7  has-text-info">
              ${publicKey.substring(2,64)}
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              That's it. We have created our very own Bitcoin wallet containing a pair of keys. While in reality there is a bit more to
              it mathematically, the key idea can be expressed as follows: The <b>Private Key</b> corresponds
              to the number of jumps on the elliptic curve starting from <b>G</b>, while the <b>Public Key</b> is the endpoint
              that we reach after performing those jumps. Generally:
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              <b class="has-text-info">Public Key</b> = <b class="has-text-primary">Private Key</b><b>*G</b>
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Again, note that the <b>Public Key</b> can be easily calculated if you know the <b>Private Key</b>, but not
              the other way round. Given the <b>Public Key</b>, there is no way to find out the <b>Private Key</b> other
              than by trial and error which is computationally infeasible (we'll get back to it later).

            <p class="tb">
              Let's assume we have an open database (no central authority) where everybody can write down transactions they want to make.
              A transaction could look something like this:
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Alice <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Bob <b>:</b> 2.5 BTC

            <p class="tb">
              Alice sends 2.5 Bitcoins to Bob. Actually the money is sent from the <b>Public Key</b> of Alice to the <b>Public
                Key
              </b> of Bob. Remember: The <b>Public Key</b> of someone corresponds to his/her Bitcoin Addresse and is visible
              to anybody.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              As the database is open and everybody can publish transactions, how can we be sure that it really was Alice who performed
              the above transaction. It could as well have been Bob posting it without Alice's consent, effectively stealing
              Alice's money. Without a way to verify that a transaction was authorized by the legitimate sender, the entire

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Don't despair, there is a way. We can use the digital equivalent of a signature that is far more secure and easier to use.

              the key concept). We now publish not only the transaction to the open database, but also attach the digital
              signature to it. Note that there is no way to reverse this calculation. Given the signature, the private key
              can not be retrieved.

              Together with the
              <b>Signature</b> we feed it into a verification function that tells us if the signature is valid for this specific
              transaction, which is only true if it was produced by the legitimate owner. Let's try it out. Send some Bitcoin

              <p class="tb">
                Let's go back to the transaction where Alice wants to send money to Bob. Alice signs the transaction <b>T</b>
                with her Private Key <b>private_Alice</b>:

              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                <b>T</b> + <b class="has-text-primary">private_Alice</b> => <b class="has-text-success">Signature</b>
              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                She publishes the transaction along with the signature. Note that the Private Key is never transferred to anyone. It's only
                used to produce the signature. Anyone can now easily check if this transaction really came from Alice:
              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                <b class="has-text-success">Signature</b> + <b class="has-text-info">public_Alice</b> => <b>T</b>
              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                And as the <b>Signature</b> is calculated by <b>T + private_Alice</b> we can substitute it in the equation:
              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                <b>T</b> + <b class="has-text-primary">private_Alice</b> + <b class="has-text-info">public_Alice</b> => <b>T</b>
              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                Here comes the magic thing about this algorithm. <u>If and only if the public and the private key come from
                  the same person/wallet, they cancel each other out.</u> This leaves us with:

              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                <b>T</b> = <b>T</b>
              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                When <b>T</b> equals <b>T</b>, we know that whoever produced this transaction was in possesion of the sender's
                <b>Private Key</b>. And unless someone stole the private key from Alice, we know it was Alice. If anyone
                tried to fake a transaction, the keys wouldn't match and the signature would be considered invalid. If Bob
                faked the transaction it would look like this:

              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                <b>T</b> + <b class="has-text-primary">private_Bob</b> + <b class="has-text-info">public_Alice</b> => <b>T</b>
              </p>

              <p class="tb">
                In this case the keys do not cancel out as they're not from the same wallet. This algorithm works on the basis of some special
                properties of our elliptic curve and is called <b> Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm</b>
                (ECDSA). It makes authentication of identity a breeze. First problem solved.

              By introducing <b>Digital Signatures</b> we made a big step towards understanding Bitcoin. But we're not quite
              there yet. The second problem still remains:
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Even if you're happy about discarding the bank, let's not forget that it provided the valuable service of maintaining a record
              of all transactions that ever occured. And this is still neccessary, because we need a way to tell how much
              money somebody has. All transactions have to be stored somewhere and every Bitcoin user must be able to rely
              on this record to be unambiguous and immutable. Otherwise nobody would give any trust and value to such money.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              <b>First idea:</b> Let's create a single Google Docs file, make it freely accessible and let everyone write
              down their transactions (with signature). We now have the entire transaction history in one place and can easily
              check if a user has enough money to make a certain transaction. But wait, the data is still on a central server
              (Google in that case) and could be manipulated or deleted. Nobody would trust such money.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              <b>Second idea:</b> Distribute a copy of this file to any computer that wants to have it. Instead of having
              our transaction database on one central server, everybody can now have its own copy on their computer. And
              every time somebody wants to make a transaction, they broadcast it over the internet to all computers that
              are listening for it. These computers are waiting day and night to receive transactions and record them in
              their own transaction database. We call them <b>Nodes</b> and every single person in the world with a computer
              and internet access can set up their own. Together they constitute the <b>Bitcoin Network</b>.

              Looks good? Yes, but there is another problem. How do we ensure that all these distributed databases are the same? Because
              when they're not, Alice could have more money according to the database of Node A than according to Node B.
              So what's the correct balance of Alice now?

              Let's suppose <b>Bob</b> and <b>Charlie</b> both sell iPhones for 1 Bitcoin each. Let's further suppose there
              exist only four Nodes in the Bitcoin Network and all of them have the exact same transaction database. According
              to this transaction history Alice owns exactly 1 Bitcoin. Alice wants to buy iPhones and that's why she creates
              the following two transactions (signed with her private key):
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Alice <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Bob <b>:</b> 1 BTC
            </p>


            <p class="tb">
              Alice <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i>
              Charlie <b>:</b> 1 BTC
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              If Alice were to broadcast these two transactions to all Nodes, every single Node would immediatly see that Alice is unable
              to perform both transactions, because she only owns 1 Bitcoin. So the Nodes would only add the first transaction
              to their database and ignore the second one. Only <b>Bob</b>'s transaction will be recorded and
              once Bob hears that from the Nodes, he will ship the iPhone.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              But what happens if Alice broadcasts <b>Bob</b>'s transaction to Node A/B and <b>Charlie</b>'s transaction
              to Node C/D? Node A would happily add <b>Bob</b>'s transaction to the database without the slightest idea that
              <b>Charlie</b>'s transaction even exists. The same would be true for Node C who only records <b>Charlie</b>'s
              transaction. We end up with different Nodes having different transaction databases. What's the correct one?
              Which one should Bob and Charlie rely on before shipping their iPhones? This is often refered to as the <b>Double
                Spending Problem</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              We need a mechanism so that everyone using Bitcoin can be 100% sure that the transaction history they are looking at has
              a single source of truth and is accepted by everyone else without any room for ambiguity. And we need to achieve
              that without reintroducing a central authority. So how do we reach a consensus between all the Nodes such that
              all Node databases are synchronized and record the exact same transactions?
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              The consensus mechanism used in Bitcoin is called <b>Proof of Work</b> and it functions like this: We hold
              a lottery between all Nodes. Participants (we call these nodes <b>Miners</b>) bundle the latest transactions
              that they received and form a small piece of database called <b>Block</b>. Roughly every ten minutes one
              <b>Miner</b> wins the lottery and has then the right to broadcast his <b>Block</b> to all other nodes. Then
              the next lottery will be hold and the process is repeated.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              What we will end up with is a bunch of <b>Blocks</b> produced by different <b>Miners</b> who were lucky enough
              to win a block lottery. Each of these <b>Blocks</b> contains a fraction of our transaction history and all
              blocks together constitute the whole transaction database. In other words, the database is split up into small
              pieces issued by different nodes.

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Before we go into the details about how this lottery actually works and why it helps us with our problem, we need to learn
              one last mathematical concept.

              What you just did on the last page (typing random characters into a textfield hoping to get a hash with a certain pattern)
              is basically the same what <b>Miners</b> do when they participate in the lottery.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Let's recall the problem one last time:
            </p>

            <div class="content tb">
              <ul>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  How do we reach a consensus between all the nodes such that all node databases are synchronized and record the exact same
                  transactions?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="tb">
              Again, what we want is a decentralized database distributed on thousands of computers that all hold the exact same transaction
              history. By introducing <b>Blocks</b> (containing transactions) that are produced roughly every
              10 minutes on the basis of a lottery, we establish some kind of order. Now transactions are <b>not</b>
              added individually to our open database as soon as they occur, but only all at once as part of the <b>Block</b>
              upon winning the lottery. Extending the database only at certain intervals in the form of well-defined blocks gives nodes
              something they can agree on. And that's what we ultimately want: Consensus.
            </p>


            <label class="label">The Lottery</label>

            <p class="tb">
              What properties do we expect a lottery to have? It should be random for sure. Plus, the more tickets you buy the higher should
              be your chances of winning. How can we apply this here?
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              We know that a <b>Block</b> simply consists of a series of transactions that a certain node received. Every
              <b>Miner</b> now takes his transaction data and calculates the SHA-256 Hash. A <b>Miner</b> wins the lottery
              when the <b>Hash</b> starts with a certain number of zeros. Let's say we are looking for 4 zeros to win the
              lottery. Obviously, it's unlikely that the hash of the block will accidentally start with 4 zeros. That's why
              every block contains an additional input field where a random number called <b>Nonce</b> can be appended. Remember:
              The slightest modification of input data will change the hash unpredictably.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              <b>Miners</b> will now take their transaction data, add a random number (Nonce) to it, calculate the <b>Hash</b>
              and check whether it starts with 4 zeros. If not, they will add a different Nonce and recalculate the hash. This process
              is called
              <b>Mining</b> and will be repeated until someone finds a Nonce that produces a valid hash (here: 4 zeros).
              In reality, the required number of leading zeros is dynamically adjusted such that 'the lottery is won' aka
              'a block is found' roughly every ten minutes.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Once a new block is found, all nodes stop mining this block immediately and build a new one. They don't include transactions
              into their new block that are already present in one of the former blocks. They also omit transactions with
              insufficient balances based on the transaction history as seen in all previous blocks. And of course, only
              transactions with a valid digital signature will be included.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Finding a valid hash is a purely random process. Modern computers can easily calculate billions of hashes per second. The
              current hashrate of the Bitcoin Network (all miners combined) is estimated to be around 50 Exahashes/Second.
              That's <b>50.000.000.000.000.000.000 hashes per second</b> . To achieve an average block time
              of 10 minutes, 19 leading zeros are currently neccessary to win the lottery. Crazy.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              The more computing power one has, the higher the chance of mining a block. But what is the incentive to invest so much energy?
              Every miner is allowed to include a special transaction into his block. A certain amount of Bitcoin (currently
              6.25 BTC) is created out of thin air and credited to the miner who is the first to find a valid block hash.
              It's called <b>Block Reward</b>. That's also the only way Bitcoin come into existence in the
              first place and why it's called mining - finding new Bitcoins and adding them to the coin supply.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Now we have <b>Blocks</b> that are hard to produce and that, together, constitute our entire transaction database.
              But they're kind of loose and it would be easy for a node to simply delete a block or add one subsequently.
              And then we are back where we started. Different nodes could have different blocks - so what blocks are the
              correct ones?

            <p class="tb">
              Actually it's just a simple modification to what we already have. Miners don't just include the transactions and the nonce
              into their blocks, but also the hash of the previous block. All this information is then used to calculate
              the hash of the current block.

              As every hash now depends on the hash of the previous block, every subsequent modification of a block would invalidate all
              following blocks. What we now have is a chain of blocks linked by cryptographic hashes. We call it a <b>Blockchain</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              To make it more clear, let's consider a greedy young man called Michael. He has recently heard that mining Bitcoin is a profitable
              business. So he installs the Bitcoin software on his computer and downloads the blockchain. He now has all
              the blocks in correct order. In other words, he now has the entire Bitcoin transaction history. And he can
              be sure that it hasn't been tampered with and that everyone else accepts it too. He then starts to listen for
              transactions. Hundreds of them come in every minute and he bundles them all up and includes them into his block
              seeking to extend the blockchain. He takes the last valid block and includes its hash into his own block. Finally
              he adds his very personal block reward transaction (6.25 BTC) to the block. He then uses all of his computational
              power to be the first to find a valid hash.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Michael is exceptionally lucky and is the first to 'find the block'. He then broadcasts the block to all other nodes. All
              nodes check the block with respect to the following protocol:
            </p>

            <div class="content tb">
              <ul>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  Calculate the hash of the block to verify its validity. Does it start with the required number of zeros?
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  Verify for each included transaction whether the digital signature is valid.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  Verify for each included transaction whether the sender has enough Bitcoin to make this transaction based on all previous
                  blocks.
                </li>

            <div class="tb">
              If all of these checks pass, miners will express their consent by building their next block on it, meaning that they'll include
              the hash of this block into their next one. Otherwise miners will ignore Michael's block and his efforts would
              have been in vain. But Michael is clever and only produces blocks that satisfy the protocol rules. Thus, miners
              build upon his block which will from now on be part of the blockchain. Michael is 6.25 BTC richer and although
              his only motive was profit, he accidentially helped build an open, decentralized and immutable transaction
              database. Hats off!
            </div>

            <div class="tb">
              Some further remarks:
            </div>

            <div class="content tb">
              <ul>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  There is a golden rule for all miners: According to the Bitcoin protocol the <b>longest chain</b> of blocks
                  is considered to be the legit Bitcoin transaction database because the most work (= CPU power) has been
                  invested to produce it (Proof of Work) . Miners therefore always seek to build upon the longest existing
                  chain because they obviously want their block (together with their reward transaction) to be part of the
                  longest chain. Blocks outside the longest chain are not considered part of the Bitcoin transaction history
                  and all their included transactions are worthless. It's like they never existed.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  Every blockchain starts with a so called <b>Genesis Block</b> which is the only block that contains no
                  previous hash because no block existed before. It only contains a reward transaction as it's the first
                  time new coins are created and prior to that no currency exists.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  It could be that two blocks are found at the exact same time by two different miners. Miners then have to select one of them
                  to build their next block on by including the corresponding hash. Once the subsequent block is found the
                  ambiguity is resolved and a definite longest chain exists again.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  A potential attack on the Bitcoin network could be that some rogue miner choses not to build on the last valid block in the
                  longest chain but rather on one of the previous blocks. A sidechain would be created and the malicious
                  miner would seek to build his own chain from then on. If he somehow manages to overtake the 'main chain'
                  by mining new blocks faster than all other miners combined, his chain would be the longest and considered
                  Bitcoin. All blocks from the 'main chain' that occured after the chain split would be worthless. Vendors
                  could have already shipped products based on transactions contained in the formerly longest chain. Although
                  that would be disastrous for the value of Bitcoin, it's highly unlikely as the attacker would need to control
                  more than 50% of the hashrate of the entire Bitcoin Network.
                </li>

                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  To avoid problems of that kind, Bitcoin recipients should wait several blocks until they consider a transaction confirmed.
                  The further back a block is in the chain, the harder it is to remove it from the longest chain as a greater
                  number of blocks would have to be remined faster than the extension of the current 'main chain'.
                </li>

                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  If somebody tried to modify a block later on, the hash would change and the chain would be broken as no consecutive blocks
                  are linked to this new hash. The entire chain would have to be remined starting from the modified block
                  which is impossible without having the majority of the hashrate.
                </li>

                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  The maximum supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 Million coins. Roughly every four years the block reward a miner receives is
                  halved. Miners can additionally collect a small transaction fee for every included transaction, incentivizing
                  them to include transactions into the block in the first place.

              What we have created is truly remarkable. The first time in human history we have a currency without central control. Using
              economic incentives and ingenious mathematics we figured out how to build and manage a fully decentralized
              database. This is revolutionary.

              The value of Bitcoin depends on the integrity of the blockchain. Anyone who wants to build on the chain needs to invest money
              (equipment and energy). And as the reward is given in Bitcoin, there is every incentive to play by the Bitcoin
              consensus rules. If you don't, you lose money.

              There have been several requests to add a more detailed explanation of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
              I've been thinking about it for a long time to get a more intuitive understanding of it. So finally here's
              my approach. Prior knowledge about Elliptic Curves (see tutorial) is assumed.

            </p>

            <p class="tb">

              The whole purpose of a digital signature is to prove that a certain piece of digital data was issued by the rightful sender.
              It makes sure that an unauthorized person can not send data in the name of someone else and it makes data manipulation
              during transmission detectable.

            </p>

            <p class="tb">

              We already know that we can use the <b class="has-text-primary">Private Key</b> to sign a transaction and that
              anyone can verify the validity of it with the sender's <b class="has-text-info">Public Key</b>. So the signature
              has to be designed in a way that it demonstrates the possession of the private key without revealing it in
              the process.

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              The goal is to find an equation that calculates a digital signature. As the private key is the only unknown variable, it's
              hard to find such an equation. It should be impossible to recover the private key from it, but still be able
              to show that the correct private key was used. Phew.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              But there is a simple solution to make the recovery of the private key impossible. By introducing a second unknown variable.
              With 'unknown' I mean only known to the producer of the signature. It's also a random 256-bit number (like
              the private key) and we call it <b>k</b>. We then calculate the elliptic curve point <b>R</b>
              using point multiplication:
            </p>

            <p class="tb has-text-centered">

              \(R = k*G\)

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Let's now take the x-coordinate of the elliptic curve point <b>R</b> and we have the first part of the signature:
              <b>r</b>
            </p>

            <p class="tb">

              So now let's think about it from the verification standpoint. What variables do we need for verfication?

            <div class="content">

              <ul type="1">
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  Public Key
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  Transaction data <b>T</b> (usually the hash of the message to be signed)
                </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  First part of the signature <b>r</b>
                </li>


              </ul>

            </div>

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              We want to include <b>T</b> and <b>r</b> into the verification equation because they could have been tampered
              with during transmission.
            </p>


            <p class="tb">
              Now let's briefly recall how operations on the elliptic curve work. We can do simple point addition e.g.
            </p>

            <p class="tb has-text-centered">

              \( 3*G + 9*G = 12*G\)

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              What if we could use this property of the elliptic curve to build the verification function. Let's try it:
            </p>

            <p class="tb has-text-centered">

              \( T*G + r*PublicKey = k*G\)

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              We are building the point \( k*G \) by adding two other curve points that include all the variables we want to use for verification.
              We'd consider a signature valid if both sides of the equation are the same. We already know the right side,
              because the x-coordinate of \( k*G \) is <b>r</b>, the first part of the signature. And we can
              calculate the left side because we know all of the variables. But why should the left side equal the right
              side? We are adding two random points to get a third random point. It can't work. But we can make it work by
              introducing another variable <b>s</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="tb has-text-centered">

              \( \dfrac{T*G + r*PublicKey}{s} = k*G\)

            </p>


            <p class="tb">
              Now the question is: Can we find a value for <b>s</b> such that this equation holds true? What if we just solve
              for <b>s</b>? Before we do that, let's recall that

            </p>

            <p class="tb has-text-centered">

              \( PublicKey = PrivateKey*G\)

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              We can now substitute the public key in our equation and get:
            </p>

            <p class="tb has-text-centered">

              \( \dfrac{T*G + r*PrivateKey*G}{s} = k*G\)

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Solved for <b>s</b>:

            </p>

            <p class="tb has-text-centered">

              \( s = \dfrac{T*G + r*PrivateKey*G}{k*G} \)

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Eliminating generator point <b>G</b> we get:
            </p>

            <p class="tb has-text-centered">

              \( s = \dfrac{T + r*PrivateKey}{k} \)

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              So that's it. The second part of the signature is <b>s</b>. Only the person in possession of the private key
              can produce it. You can send it out to the world together with <b>r</b>, <b>T</b> and your <b>public key</b>
              to prove that T comes from you.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              A verifying party can't retrieve the private key from <b>s</b> because of the second unknown variable <b>k</b>.
              One equation, two unknowns. That's not going to work.
            </p>


            <p class="tb">
              <b>Verification fails if</b>

            <div class="content">

              <ul type="1">
                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  an incorrect private key (one that doesn't correspond to the public key) is used. Then the private key used in producing
                  <b>s</b>
                  isn't equal to the one used to calculate the public key. Thus they don't cancel each other.

                </li>

                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  transaction data <b>T</b> is manipulated during transmission. Then <b>T</b> used in producing <b>s</b>
                  isn't equal to the one used in the verification function. Thus they don't cancel each other.
                </li>

                <li style="padding-bottom:0.75rem;">
                  the first part of the signature <b>r</b> is manipulated during transmission. Then <b>r</b> used in producing
                  <b>s</b>
                  isn't equal to the one used in the verification function. Thus they don't cancel each other.
                </li>

              </ul>

            </div>
            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Think about each of these cases with regard to the verification function. As a verifier you receive \( s\), \( r\), \( T\)
              and \( PublicKey\). You calculate the sum of elliptic curve points on the left side of the equation and take
              the x-coordinate of the resulting point. If it equals <b>r</b>, the signature is valid.
            </p>

            <p class="tb has-text-centered">

              \( \left( \dfrac{T*G + r*PublicKey}{s} \right) _{x-coordinate} = r\)

            </p>

            <p class="tb">
              Now it's your turn. Verify the correctness of this algorithm by putting <b>s</b> into the above equation.
              What do you get on the left side? Remember <b>r</b> is the x-coordinate of <b>k*G</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="tb">

              <label class="label is-small">Important</label>

              You can't reuse the same <b>k</b> for signing different data. Because then you would have two equations and
              could solve for the private key. Think about it. For every signature, you need a new random <b>k</b>.
            </div>

              It's still not the whole story. In reality, the coordinates of curve points are not used as they come out, but are reduced
              using modular arithmetics. That means that every curve point is divided by a very large known number <b>n</b>
              and only the rest of this division is used. For example 11 mod 5 = 1 or 19 mod 7 = 5. This is the actual reason why it's
              impossible to reverse operations on the elliptic curve and to retrieve the private key from the public key.
              Concerning ECDSA, every equation we have just seen is reduced with <b>mod n</b>. But this doesn't
              change the algorithm itself and the idea behind it. All the considerations we have just made are still valid.
